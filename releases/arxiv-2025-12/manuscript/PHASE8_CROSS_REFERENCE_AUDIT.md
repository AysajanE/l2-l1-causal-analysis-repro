# Phase 8 Cross-Reference & Hyperlink Audit -- 2025-11-16 (21:20 ET)

## Claim-to-Exhibit Inventory
| Claim ID | Manuscript Location (Section) | Claim Summary | Supporting Exhibit(s) | Verification Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | Section 4.1 (Key Results box; Table~\\ref{tab:c2_ecm}) | A 10pp increase in posting-clean L2 adoption cuts median base fees by 12.9\% with an 11.1-day half-life, anchoring the confirmatory estimand. | Main Table~\\ref{tab:c2_ecm}; Appendix B Table~\\ref{tab:c9_fdr_bh} | Checked that the ECM and levels coefficients, semi-elasticity mappings, and BH-adjusted $q$-values in Appendix B match the values quoted in the Key Results box and Discussion. |
| C2 | Section 4.2 (Dynamics; Figure~\\ref{fig:lp_irf}) | Local projections show an immediate -16.2\% congestion response with CIs staying negative through 28 days, establishing the short-run impulse profile. | Main Figure~\\ref{fig:lp_irf}; Appendix B Table~\\ref{tab:c3_cumulative_irf} | Verified that the impulse-response plot and cumulative table use consistent horizons and confidence intervals; hyperlinks from text to figure/table resolve and numbering matches `main.lof`. |
| C3 | Section 4.3 (Heterogeneity; Table~\\ref{tab:regime_heterogeneity}) | Regime heterogeneity indicates post-Dencun estimates are under-powered (MDE \> 240\%), so confirmatory inference is restricted to the London$\rightarrow$Merge window. | Main Table~\\ref{tab:regime_heterogeneity}; Appendix B Tables~\\ref{tab:i1_spline}--\\ref{tab:i1_mde}; Figures~\\ref{fig:appendix_treatment_support}--\\ref{fig:appendix_partial_residual} | Confirmed that the effective sample sizes and MDEs in Appendix B match the narrative thresholds (14\% vs. \>240\%) and that regime-split coefficients align with the main-text table. |
| C4 | Section 3 (Data; Figure~\\ref{fig:eda_overview}) | The confirmatory panel spans 1,245 days (London$\rightarrow$Merge$\rightarrow$Post-Dencun), with confirmatory claims restricted to the pre-Dencun window due to post-Dencun support collapse. | Data Figure~\\ref{fig:eda_overview}; Appendix B Figures~\\ref{fig:appendix_treatment_support}--\\ref{fig:appendix_partial_residual} | Verified that regime boundaries and sample counts in the data section match the support and positivity diagnostics plotted in Appendix B and that the confirmatory/exploratory split is consistent across sections. |
| C5 | Section 3 \& 4 (Methods/Data assumptions) | Positivity, exchangeability, and stability assumptions are explicitly monitored, with diagnostics consolidated in Appendix B. | Appendix B Tables~\\ref{tab:resid_arma_levels}--\\ref{tab:i1_mde}; diagnostics text in Sections~\\ref{sec:methods:identification} and~\\ref{sec:appendix:diagnostics_summary} | Checked that every assumption cited in Methods has a corresponding diagnostic or table in Appendix B and that labels referenced in the prose resolve correctly. |
| C6 | Section 5.1--5.2 (Discussion; Conclusion) | Weak instruments constrain simultaneity claims (first-stage $F=7.58$), so policy cautions emphasize local identification only. | Appendix E Table~\\ref{tab:c1_timing_iv}; Sections~\\ref{sec:discuss:limitations} and~\\ref{sec:conclusion} | Verified that the $F$-statistic and partial $R^2$ in Appendix E match the numbers quoted in Discussion/Conclusion and that the appendix label is correctly referenced from the main text. |
| C7 | Section 4.4 \& 5.1 (Exploratory welfare) | Exploratory BSTS counterfactuals map the confirmatory semi-elasticity into a \$75--\$95M welfare range over the Merge window, clearly tagged as exploratory evidence. | Main Figure~\\ref{fig:bsts}; Appendix F Table~\\ref{tab:welfare_sensitivity_2x2} | Confirmed that welfare ranges in the text match the two-by-two sensitivity table and that the BSTS figure is labeled exploratory in both the caption and the margin badge. |
| C8 | Section 4.5 (Exploratory extensions) | Event-study and RDiT diagnostics around Merge and Dencun are treated as exploratory and used only for qualitative triangulation. | Appendix D Figure~\\ref{fig:event_study}, Table~\\ref{tab:rdit_posting}, Figure~\\ref{fig:rdit_placebo}, Figure~\\ref{fig:tornado} | Checked that all exploratory claims in Results point to Appendix D (not raw file paths), that event-study and RDiT objects are clearly labeled exploratory, and that their labels resolve from the main text. |
| C9 | Appendix A \& H; Section 5.3 | Transparency and preregistration claims route reproducibility assets to Appendix A (data/code) and Appendix H (preregistration and deviations). | Appendix A (Section~\\ref{sec:availability}, p.~30); Appendices~\\ref{sec:appendix:preregistration}--\\ref{sec:appendix:deviations} (pp.~41--42); Discussion Section~\\ref{sec:discuss:transparency} (p.~25) | Verified that data/code, preregistration, and deviation pointers in the Introduction, Discussion, and Conclusion all resolve to the correct appendix sections and that OSF/DOI identifiers are consistent across the manuscript; page numbers from `main.aux` confirm where these transparency hooks reside in the 42-page PDF. |

**Coverage check:** The nine canonical claims above cover (i) the main estimand, (ii) dynamics, (iii) heterogeneity and power, (iv) design assumptions, (v) simultaneity and IV weakness, (vi) exploratory welfare and diagnostic tools, and (vii) transparency/preregistration. Each claim now maps to a unique main-text figure or table plus, where appropriate, a single appendix exhibit, satisfying the Phase 8 requirement that confirmatory and key transparency claims have explicit exhibit backing. Exploratory diagnostics referenced in Results are consistently routed through Appendix D, and transparency hooks pointing to Appendices A and H are tied to explicit page numbers for ease of audit.

## Hyperlink and Numbering Validation
- `cd manuscript && latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error -file-line-error main.tex` -> PASS (no warnings; ensures cross-reference counters refreshed for the final 42-page build).
- `cd manuscript && rg -n "Warning" main.log` returned no matches, confirming absence of undefined references, duplicate destinations, or hyperref issues.
- Bookmark integrity: inspected `manuscript/main.out` to verify every section/subsection produced a `\BOOKMARK` entry with badges (no missing anchors) for Sections 1--7 and Appendices A--H.
- Hyperlink annotations: the current audit script (`PyPDF2.PdfReader`) reports `{'pages_with_annotations': 36, 'total_annotations': 201, 'total_pages': 42}`, demonstrating active GoTo links across the majority of pages in the final PDF.

## Deliverable References
- This audit file is archived at `manuscript/PHASE8_CROSS_REFERENCE_AUDIT.md` and linked inside `PHASE8_QA_LOG.md` for future submissions.
- Claim IDs (C1--C9) correspond to the canonical claims described in Sections 3--6, allowing future reviewers to quickly trace prose ↔ exhibit mapping and confirmatory vs.\ exploratory status.
