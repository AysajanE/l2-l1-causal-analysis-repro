# Forbidden Phrases for Manuscript CI Checks
# Item 10: Calibrated Claims Implementation
# Created: 2025-10-18
# Purpose: Prevent regression to uncalibrated language in manuscript

# CRITICAL: These phrases must NOT appear in the main manuscript text
# (sections 01-06_*.tex, abstract.tex)

## 1. Incorrect welfare estimates (old inflated numbers)
$97.35 billion
$97.35B
$79.87B
$118.45B
$710.56 million per day
$711 million
$10.6 trillion
$10.6T
$96.50 billion
$96.5B

## 2. Overstated causal language for base fee ITS
definitive affirmative
definitively demonstrates
conclusive evidence
statistically significant effect on base fees
significant reduction in base fees
# Note: "significant" is OK for S_t (scarcity) which has p<0.001

## 3. Missing temporal scope qualifiers
# These should always be qualified with "137-day subset" or "14.41% coverage"
welfare gains over the full period
complete pre-Dencun analysis
comprehensive welfare assessment
full 950-day period analyzed

## 4. Unqualified exploratory analyses
# Event study and RDiT should always be marked as "exploratory" or "validation"
event study demonstrates
event study proves
RDiT confirms causal
RDiT establishes

## 5. Missing precision caveats for ITS
# Base fee ITS should always mention "limited precision" or "p=0.17"
ITS significantly reduces
ITS demonstrates significant
base fee effect is significant
# Exception: scarcity (S_t) IS significant

## ALLOWED PHRASES (for reference):
# - $79.6 million (base-only) over 137-day subset
# - $2.43 million per day
# - suggestive evidence (for base fee ITS)
# - directional negative effect
# - limited precision (p=0.17)
# - strong mechanistic support (for S_t)
# - exploratory analysis (for event study/RDiT)
# - 14.41% of available pre-Dencun days
# - confirmatory ITS analysis

## CI CHECK COMMAND:
# grep -f forbidden_phrases.txt sections/0[1-6]_*.tex sections/abstract.tex
# Should return NO matches if compliant
