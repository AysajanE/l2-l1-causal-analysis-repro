# ============================================================================
# OVERALL ASSESSMENT
# ============================================================================

overall_assessment:
  methodological_quality: EXCELLENT
  statistical_evidence: SUGGESTIVE
  robustness_demonstration: STRONG
  transparency: EXCELLENT
  reproducibility: VERIFIED

summary: |
  The Phase 10 robustness battery demonstrates EXCELLENT methodological rigor:
  - Zero leakage violations (perfect mediator exclusion)
  - 87% sign consistency (above 75% threshold)
  - 100% convergence rate (no failures)
  - Placebo tests validate identification strategy
  - Coefficient stability across HAC lags, outlier handling, demand proxies

  The baseline total effect estimate (β = -0.66, p = 0.17) is NOT statistically
  significant at conventional levels, but the S_t scarcity outcome shows strong
  significance (β = -1.53, p < 0.001). This is interpreted as SUGGESTIVE evidence
  requiring triangulation with Phases 6/7/9 for convergent validity.

  CONDITIONAL APPROVAL granted: Proceed to Phase 11 with four documented conditions
  ensuring appropriate interpretation and uncertainty quantification.

# ============================================================================
# CONDITIONS FOR PROCEEDING
# ============================================================================

# KNOWN ISSUES & DOCUMENTATION
# ============================================================================

known_issues:
  issue_1:
    title: "Baseline effect not statistically significant"
    description: "β = -0.66, p = 0.17 (NOT significant at α=0.05)"
    severity: "MODERATE"
    impact: "Requires calibrated manuscript language; cannot claim strong evidence"
    mitigation: |
      - Condition 1: Use "suggestive evidence" framing
      - Emphasize S_t significant result (p < 0.001) as mechanistic support
      - Triangulate with Phases 6/7/9 for convergent validity
    documented_in:
      - "results/phase10_robustness_onepager.md"
      - "results/phase10_respec_decisions.md (Decision 1)"

  issue_2:
    title: "Event window effects concentrate impact"
    description: "Excluding events reduces magnitude by 32% (β = -0.445 vs -0.656)"
    severity: "LOW"
    impact: "Effects are concentrated but not solely driven by event periods"
    mitigation: |
      - Baseline includes events (policy-relevant protocol changes)
      - Event exclusion reported as robustness check (both results transparent)
      - Interpretation: Both event-driven jumps AND gradual effects
    documented_in:
      - "results/phase10_respec_decisions.md (Decision 2)"

  issue_3:
    title: "Detrended specification sign flip"
    description: "β = +2.13 due to multicollinearity (VIF > 10)"
    severity: "LOW"
    impact: "Known artifact; does not invalidate baseline"
    mitigation: |
      - Include in Table 7 with footnote annotation
      - Full explanation in Methods Appendix §A.4
      - Visual distinction (italics/gray) to signal non-standard spec
    documented_in:
